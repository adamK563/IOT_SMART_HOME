## Overview
In this project, we leverage IoT devices, sensors, and actuators to connect and control different components of a typical home. The main objective is to enable users to monitor and manage their home remotely through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Remote Control:** Control various home devices, such as lights, thermostats, door locks, and security systems, through a mobile application or web interface.
- **Sensor Integration:** Utilize a range of sensors to monitor environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and motion, to enhance comfort and energy efficiency.
- **Automation:** Implement automation rules and scenarios for tasks like turning on/off lights based on occupancy, adjusting thermostat settings based on weather conditions, and more.
- **Security:** Enhance home security by integrating surveillance cameras, door/window sensors, and alarms, and receive real-time notifications on security events.
- **Energy Management:** Monitor and optimize energy consumption by integrating smart plugs, energy meters, and providing insights on usage patterns.
