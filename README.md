The Coca-Cola Factory Machine Emulator is a project designed to simulate and monitor the filling and sealing machines/systems in a Coca-Cola factory. It provides insights into the amount of liters of cola and bottles that can be filled, and it includes a notification system to alert users when the cola levels are running low.

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of the Coca-Cola factory by emulating the filling and sealing machines/systems. By providing insights into the amount of cola that can be filled and notifying users when levels are running low, the project contributes to better management of the production process.

## Features

- Emulation of filling and sealing machines/systems.
- Calculation of the amount of liters of cola and bottles that can be filled.
- Real-time monitoring of cola levels.
- Notification system to alert users when cola levels are running low.

## Technologies Used

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A plotting library for the Python programming language.
- [paho-mqtt](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php) - MQTT client library used for communication.
- [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - Python bindings for the Qt application framework.
- MQhive Cloud - Cloud platform used for data storage and communication.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coca-cola-emulator.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`.

```
